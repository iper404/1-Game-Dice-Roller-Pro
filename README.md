# Project 1: Dice-Roller-Pro
Created in the 3rd week of my CS201 course

This is one of the first projects I worked on. I was still learning a lot -- so there wasn't much use of functions to simplify the 'main' code. However, the program still turned out highly functional and entertaining and i'm proud of the result. Check out the screenshots to see what it looks like, or download the exe to play.

C++ Dice Roller Game Program (v.s. CPU, Player 2, or from a file)

Runs via a menu while loop, allows user to rematch as soon as a round is completed.
