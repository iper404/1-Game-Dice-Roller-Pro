# Project 1: Dice-Roller-Pro
Created in the 3rd week of my CS201 course

This is one of the first projects I worked on. I was still learning a lot -- so there wasn't much use of functions to simplify the 'main' code. However, the program still turned out highly functional and entertaining and i'm proud of the result. Check out the screenshots to see what it looks like, or download the exe to play.

C++ Dice Roller Game Program (v.s. CPU, Player 2, or from a file)

Runs via a menu while loop, allows user to rematch as soon as a round is completed.

Allows user to choose:
- Play game against CPU
- Play game against player 2 (2-player mode)
- Play a game from file input
- Quit

- VS CPU allows player to choose the max sides per dice as well as how many dice will be rolled.

- VS Player 2 allows players to input their own names. It then rolls a random number for each player to decide who chooses the max sides per dice and how many dice will be rolled.

The winner is whoever rolled the highest total. Displays the average dice roll as well as the sum total.
