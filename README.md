# Dice-Roller-Pro
C++ Dice Roller Game Program (v.s. CPU, Player 2, or from a file)
Probably the most fun i've had coding so far.
Runs via a menu while loop, allows user to rematch as soon as a round is completed. Doesn't exit until user says quit. Put a lot of time and effort into the formatting to make it look nice.
